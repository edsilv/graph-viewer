		"text": "<p>I am inspired by artists and filmmakers who experiment with the interstices and intersections between the viewer and their work. The question of how <i>space</i>, as physical distance, can generate new forms of narrative has been the foundation for my artistic research at the Netherlands Film Academy.</p><p><i><b>Spatial Narratives</b></i> ​ questions ways in which narratives can be experienced spatially by the viewer, but also the role of narrative in communicating and externalising the everyday spaces we inhabit. Whether geographical locations or virtual spaces in memory, it is my conjecture that a single linear narrative cannot adequately convey the multiplicity, fluidity and connectivity which define our experience of them. From traditional storytelling to Virtual Reality, I've stepped outside of the cinema to consider how space and narrative co-exist in other media and in other forms.</p><p><i>'Untitled'</i> combines the interactivity from Virtual Reality with the spatial and aesthetic qualities of a moving image installation. Through interaction with the installation the viewer experiences the co-existing narratives of two people, in two times, joined by a ruined house in the village of Srbská.</p><p><i>Srbská</i>, a place I lived in and returned to for almost a decade is known also as Wünschendorf; a thriving Sudeten village which witnessed the exile of its entire ethnic German population in 1946. Wünschendorf’s decline into the cluster of houses now clinging to the Czech and Polish border situate it in the narrative I find most fascinating of all, that of memory. I have travelled to Germany, the Czech Republic and Poland to record the testimonies of those who remember the village. With each narrative I encounter, the more certain I am that the village can only exist in a multiplicity of these various and often contradictory narratives.</p><p>This certainty is behind the creation of Srbska.org, an online archive and space for the contribution and collection of stories and artefacts from the village. Still in its infancy it continues to grow through collaboration with researchers, oral historians and archivists.</p><p>Finally, <i>Spatial Narratives</i> is a broad collection of essays, works and ideas designed to be navigated through either the form which my research has taken or the theme it has explored.</p>"
